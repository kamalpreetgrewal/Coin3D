To be able to use this, you should have SoQt and Coin3D libraries installed on your system.

How to run:

1. Clone the repository. Next open the directory in terminal.
2. Run qmake -project. It will generate cone.pro file.
3. Run qmake. 
4. Run make. In case of some SoQt missing errors, open the Makefile. Go to LIBS and edit -lSoQt and -lCoin at the end.
5. Again run make and next ./cone. A cone will show up in ExaminerViewer window.
